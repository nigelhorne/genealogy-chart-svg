# Program to draw a representation of a person's ancestry.
#
# The program reads from a data file. The data file needs one line per person
# in the tree. Each line is a comma-separated list of data about a person.
# There are three mandatory elements and one optional one.
#
# The three mandatory elements are person number (see below for explanation),
# name and birth year. The optional element is death year. If death year is
# omitted then the program assumes the person is still alive.
#
# Person number
# This is all driven by the person number. There's a simple rule for working
# out the number that should be associated with a person.
#
# If a person in the data file has the number $n, then that person's father is
# 2 * $n and that person's mother is (2 * $n) + 1. The person that you're
# starting from is number 1.
#
# So if I'm person one, then my father is 2 and my mother is 3. My four
# grandparents are 4, 5, 6 and 7. And so on.
#
# This leads some interesting mathematical properties. Most of them I'll leave
# to you to find out, but I'll just point out that with the exception of
# person 1 (who can obviously be of either sex) all of the men have even
# numbers and the women have odd numbers.
#
# This is also known as "Ahnentafel".
